# Git Learning Repository

Welcome to the Git Learning Repository! This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding various Git concepts and workflows.

## About Git

### Commit

A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the project files at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier (SHA-1 hash) and includes the author's name, email, timestamp, and a commit message describing the changes.

### Branch

A branch is a parallel line of development in a Git repository. It allows multiple developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be created, merged, and deleted as needed.

### Fork

A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forking is commonly used for contributing to open-source projects, where you can make modifications in your fork and then submit a pull request to propose changes to the original repository.

### Merge

Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. It is commonly used to integrate feature branches into the main codebase (e.g., merging a feature branch into the `main` branch). Git performs automatic merges when possible, but manual intervention may be required to resolve conflicts.

### Pull Request

A pull request (PR) is a mechanism for proposing changes to a repository on GitHub. It allows developers to review, discuss, and collaborate on code changes before merging them into the main branch. Pull requests typically include a summary of changes, related issues, and any additional context necessary for review.

### Push Request

A push request is a term sometimes used to describe the action of pushing changes from a local Git repository to a remote repository. Unlike a pull request, which is initiated by contributors to propose changes to a shared repository on platforms like GitHub, a push request is a unilateral action performed by a repository owner or contributor to update the contents of a remote repository.
